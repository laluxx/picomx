## Features

Animation Tag working (tested on awesome wm) "work in progress" gets "_NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOP" and "_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP" of the root xprop.

animation-for-menu-windows = animation for dock type.

## Problems

To use shader-fg i recommend to exclude the window from animations because is not working when animating.

To view unmap animation mantain fade true if you want to remove the fade set fade-in-step/fade-out-step to 1 .

Picom tag anim is not working always as expected.
